# Obsidian Share

There are times I want to create a public link to one of my notes, without having an entire "digital garden" through Obsidian Publish.

Enter **Obsidian Share**. To share a page, just run a single Templater script. Templater is also optional - it's plain Javascript so you can launch it from anywhere.

[See it live in action here](https://file.obsidianshare.com/572e1ae4a0aeadf5943862d1deaf8fe6.html), along with installation instructions and usage.

For any feedback or issues [post those in the forum thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/42788/).

You can also host your own private version, [see details here](https://file.obsidianshare.com/5d9dadb08ee4ec00323c694930722702.html).

## Features

ðŸ”¹ Uploads using your current theme.

ðŸ”¹ Local and remote image support.

ðŸ”¹ Supports anything that Obsidian Preview mode does, like rendered Dataview queries and any custom CSS you might have enabled.

ðŸ”¹ Supports callouts with full styling:

ðŸ”¹ Filenames are anonymised through hashing so people can't discover your other shared notes.

ðŸ”¹ If your shared note links to another note which is also shared, that link will also function on the shared webpage. 

ðŸ”¹ Frontmatter is stripped on upload to avoid leaking unwanted data.

## Installation

There are two options to running Obsidian Share:

1. No setup required, just use my public share server. [See the instructions here](https://file.obsidianshare.com/572e1ae4a0aeadf5943862d1deaf8fe6.html).

or

2. Set up your own private server. [See the instructions here](https://file.obsidianshare.com/5d9dadb08ee4ec00323c694930722702.html).
