# Obsidian Share

Free, encrypted public note sharing for Obsidian.

## Features

- Uploads using your current theme.
- Local and remote image support.
- Supports anything that Obsidian Preview mode does, like rendered Dataview queries and any custom CSS you might have enabled.
- Supports callouts with full styling.
- If your shared note links to another note which is also shared, that link will also function on the public page.
- Frontmatter is stripped on upload by default to avoid leaking unwanted data.
