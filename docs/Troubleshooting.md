# Troubleshooting

If your shared note isn't displaying correctly, before creating an Issue try these steps first:

1. Change to Reading mode.
2. Scroll to the top of the note.
3. Use the command `Force re-upload of all data for this note`.
4. Refresh the shared note a few times to make sure you're seeing the latest copy rather than a cached copy.

And see if that gets the note to share correctly.

## MathJax / LaTeX

If your MathJax / LaTeX elements are not displaying correctly, `Force re-upload` the note which is having the issues to force your custom stylesheet to be rebuilt with the MathJax classes included.
